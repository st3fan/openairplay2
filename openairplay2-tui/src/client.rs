//! The WebSocket client: keeps a connection to a receiver's now-playing
//! endpoint, and reports what happens on it to the display.
//!
//! The receiver may be down when the display starts, may restart under it,
//! or may live on a machine that reboots — so this reconnects for as long as
//! the display runs, and the display shows the connection state rather than
//! a stale screen or an exit.
